# Hello ASP.NET!

This is a tiny Razor Pages example on Glitch based on the original dotnet new template.

# Changes from the default

- No Bootstrap and stripped back layout
- No jQuery
- Removed "development" mode and "production" CSS filters from the views
- Glitch executes the web app in development mode by default so you see detailed errors

## Your Project

On the front-end,

- Edit `Pages/Index.cshtml` for the index.
- Edit `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` for the layout
- Edit files in `wwwroot` for static content.
- Server side logic lives in `Pages/[Pagename].cs`

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
